In this Power BI project, I partnered with a fictional avocado distributor to deliver data-driven insights into sales performance across U.S. regions.

🔍 Key Objectives:

Analyze monthly avocado sales trends

Compare organic vs. conventional volumes

Identify growth patterns and anomalies

📊 Features Delivered:

A fully dynamic Month-Year performance table:

Total volume this month vs. last

% Growth with intuitive icon indicators

Organic sales volume & % share (highlighted if <2.5%)

KPI visuals for:

Small Bag share of total bags

Regional sales starting with “South”

A Revenue by Region visualization for strategic targeting

⚙️ Techniques Used:

Power BI DAX: CALCULATE, DATEADD, DIVIDE, FORMAT, etc.

Time Intelligence via CALENDARAUTO() and a separate Date Table

Data modeling and relationship design (One-to-Many)

Region data cleaning & transformation in Power Query to ensure valid groupings

✅ Verified data accuracy using Excel (Pivot Tables & Subtotals)
🔁 Removed duplicates and reconciled unexpected spikes (e.g., Nov 2015 volume)

💼 This project simulates a real-world client deliverable, optimizing regional marketing decisions using clean visuals and actionable KPIs.
