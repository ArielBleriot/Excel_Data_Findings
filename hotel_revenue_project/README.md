I recently completed a data analysis project that combines SQL Server and Power BI to analyze hotel booking data from 2018 to 2020. The goal was to extract insights on revenue trends, market segments, and meal costs.

✅ Key Highlights:

SQL Server used for data cleaning, joins, and feature engineering with over 3 Excel sheets imported and merged (2018$, 2019$, 2020$)

Implemented common table expressions (CTEs) and JOINs to enrich hotel data with market and meal cost details

Calculated discounted revenue using custom logic:
([stays_in_week_nights]+[stays_in_weekend_nights]) * ([adr]*(1-[Discount]))

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard with visuals showing:

Yearly revenue trends

Revenue by market segment

Impact of discounts and meal types

📁 The full project includes:

SQL queries (.sql)

Power BI report file (.pbix)

🚀 Skills Used: SQL Server, Power BI, DAX, Data Modeling, Data Cleaning, Dashboard Design
