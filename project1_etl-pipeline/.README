# 🌩️ **AWS Serverless ETL Pipeline**

This project demonstrates how to build a **scalable, serverless ETL pipeline on AWS** to process and analyze weather data efficiently.

## 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| <span style="color:#FF9900"><b>AWS S3</b></span> | Stores **incoming raw JSON files** and processed **Parquet files** |
| <span style="color:#FF9900"><b>AWS Lambda</b></span> | Triggered on new file uploads, **flattens JSON** using pandas, writes **Parquet** back to S3 |
| <span style="color:#FF9900"><b>AWS Glue</b></span> | Catalogs processed data for querying |
| <span style="color:#FF9900"><b>Amazon Athena</b></span> | Enables **SQL-based analytics** on S3-stored data |

## 💻 **Tech Stack**

- **Python**: `pandas`, `boto3`, `pyarrow`  
- **AWS Services**: S3, Lambda, Glue, Athena  

---

## ⚡ **Key Features**

- Converts **JSON → Parquet** for optimized storage and fast querying  
- Fully **automated pipeline** triggered on file upload  
- Designed with **scalability** and **cost-efficiency** in mind  

---

## 🛠️ **What I Learned**

- Event-driven data processing using **AWS Lambda**  
- **Schema evolution** and **data partitioning** best practices  
- Handling **Lambda packaging issues** with dependencies  

---

## ⚠️ **Challenges Faced**

- URL decoding of **S3 object keys** from event payload  
- Configuring **IAM policies** for secure Lambda execution  
- Managing **Lambda execution time and memory** for large datasets
